## üîß Environment Variables

These values are safe to expose and typically include configuration for non-sensitive settings such as service endpoints, feature toggles, and public keys.
This separation ensures flexibility across environments (e.g., development, staging, production) without modifying source code.

## üîê Secrets (get from AWS Secrets Manager)

The following sensitive configuration values are already defined in the Task Definition via AWS Secrets Manager (under `secrets`).  
This approach follows best practices by separating secrets from the source code.
